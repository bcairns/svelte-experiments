# Matrix Reloaded

A Svelte implementation of the ["Matrix digital rain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) effect, with a control panel and both DOM/canvas based rendering available.

I'm using this project to help me learn more about Svelte.


### Design Goals

- High-performance
- Clarity and readability (this has suffered a bit with all the new features, still a work in progress)
- Flexibility, options, bells & whistles

### Installation

Requires [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/).

`npm install` from project root.

### Usage

`npm run dev` from project root, then view http://localhost:8080/

### Approach

Building on Matrix DOM and Matrix Canvas, adding a control panel and tons of flexibility.

Canvas mode is still new and a bit "experimental", definitely some issues when adjusting controls.

### Other

`npm run build` for a production build.  Currently compiles to just 7107 bytes of JS! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
