# Matrix Canvas

A Svelte implementation of the ["Matrix digital rain"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) effect, using canvas for rendering.

I'm using this project to help me learn more about Svelte.


### Design Goals

- High-performance
- Simplicity, clarity, and readability

### Installation

Requires [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/).

`npm install` from project root.

### Usage

`npm run dev` from project root, then view http://localhost:8080/

### Approach

This is essentially a fork of matrix-dom, modified to render to canvas.

### Other

`npm run build` for a production build.  Currently compiles to just 7730 bytes of JS! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
